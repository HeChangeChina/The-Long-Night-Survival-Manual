description = The product was a top semi-automatic rifle product that Lauched by Dalton Company™ in 954. Its outstanding shooting feel and stable energy output made it one of the highest selling products at that time. However, with the passage of time, its shortcomings such as excessive weight, excessive volume, and only semi-automatic launch have led to its gradual replacement by new products. Until the Magic Tsunami, only collectors and old-fashioned gun enthusiasts would be interested in it.
